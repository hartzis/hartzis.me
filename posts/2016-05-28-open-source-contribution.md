I started my developing adventures in javascript and front end development a little over two years ago, and before javascript I enjoyed scripting with python. While using both of these languages I've benefited tremendously from open source technologies, specifically [GDAL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/) with python and [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/) with [redux](http://redux.js.org/).

Open source projects have had and continue to have a dramatic and profound affect on my career and life. A great example is the community around [react](http://facebook.github.io/react/). It is so helpful, encouraging, and positive.

## Contributing to open source

My teachers at [refactorU](http://www.refactoru.com/) were the first ones to mention contributing to open source. They said 'if you found a bug, fix it and make a pull request', so I did. My [first contribution](https://github.com/loganbestwick/geo-tools/commits?author=hartzis) to open source was simple, but it felt great knowing I gave back and possibly helped someone else.

### React community

After contributing to a few other small libraries and getting PR's merged in I was added as a member and maintainer on a simple yet powerful react component - [react-swipeable](https://github.com/dogfessional/react-swipeable/graphs/contributors). I truly felt honored and took the responsibility seriously and as I contributed to react-swipeable it helped build my confidence and I started to look for opportunities to contribute to bigger projects.

I was able to [contribute](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/commits?author=hartzis) to [redux](http://redux.js.org/) early-ish in its evolution in an attempt to help with some examples. [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) is truly a stupendously nice person and he was amazingly [responsive and helpful](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/424)!

## Open source sum up

I can attest that open source contributing is fun, fulfilling, and actually not too hard to do. Many open source maintainers need almost any help they can get, and a great way to get started is just helping with documentation! I encourage all entry level devs to attempt to contribute back to their communities.

Most of my posts are fairly small and with this post I just wanted to lightly touch on my personal experience with open source. It has been an amazing and rewarding journey that I wish to continue even though I am slightly scared of open source fatigue.

Here's to a bright, open, and knowledge filled sharing future!
