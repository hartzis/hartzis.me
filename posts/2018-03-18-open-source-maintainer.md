* talk a little about consistency
* just responding in general
* being humble
* understanding that those posting issues took time out of their life to file an issue they must have really had an issue
* be understanding
* probably no one knows the code better than yourself
* help others understand what is happening under the hood
* reference versions
* reference code
* how being a maintainer of a package that is dependent on another package will help you stay informed with changes and updates to the dependant package. for example with react-swipeable when react comes out with changes to existing methods sometimes users will just make PRs to react-swipeable to make it compatable with the changes!

what to do a better:
* getting word out( promote project - https://github.com/chrisbolin/offline-talk/blob/master/src/slides.js#L73)
* responding to twitter posts that mention react-swipeable
* find out what projects are using it and see if they need any help with implementation
* respond to blog posts where people mention react-swipeabl (ttps://medium.com/@incubation.ff/build-your-own-css-carousel-in-react-part-one-86f71f6670ca)
