Last weekend RefactorU's team 'frackin toasters' programmed an [ar-drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
---

This was definitely one of the most rewarding programming days I have ever had.  Not only did we program a drone, we used input from an [ultrasonic sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8501) to know where the drone was in relation to us!

>The drone would reverse when we walked towards it, approach us when we walked backwards, and stay put when we stood still.

### Our team took home the 'Top node-copter engineering team' and the award for using external hardware!
