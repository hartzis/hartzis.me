I'd like to give a shout out to [Eric Saupe](http://ericsaupe.com/) for creating an amazing directive.  While I was building [MapTweet.Info](https://github.com/hartzis/MapTweet.Info) I needed something that wasn't JQuery to track when an input was 'submitted' with enter.

### I found this directive from Eric below.
