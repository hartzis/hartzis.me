I'm working on creating an interactive table that displays thousands of records that needs to be capable of both filtering by specific parameters and sortable. So here is a short and sweet chat about my adventure.

>AngularJS offers great modularity with directives, so I knew there had to be a powerful and customizable table directive out there somewhere.  

I found three amazing angular 'table' directives:

- <a href="http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/" target="_blank">ngTable</a>
- <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/" target="_blank">ng-grid</a>
- <a href="http://moonstorm.github.io/trNgGrid/beta/index.html" target="_blank">trNgGrid</a>

<h3>ng-grid, *now ui-grid<div class="ng-social-container"><ul class="ng-social" id="nggrid-github"></ul></div></h3>

</figure>

>*Note ng-grid is now ui-grid and I would definitely reevalute using it!*

I first looked at ng-grid since it was backed by the angular-ui team. It seems to have slowed down its development sadly and I also needed strong pagination and ‘items per page’. View example [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/T6qaQX?p=info).  

Another thing that was interesting about ng-grid is that it doesn't use the base html tags for a table. No table, tbody, tr, or td's; everything is constructed with div's. Which means css frameworks like bootstrap won't play nice right out of the box.

<h3>trNgGrid<div class="ng-social-container"><ul class="ng-social" id="trnggrid-github"></ul></div></h3>

trNgGrid didn’t quite have the backing and support I was looking for either, and its current release didn’t have the strong stable features of its next release. The creator also forgot to include a way to quickly demo and explore the directive using plnkr/jsfiddle or any of those.  

{% highlight html %}
<table tr-ng-grid="" items="myItems"></table>
{% endhighlight %}

It is amazing self contained meaning you only need the html line above to create a dynamic table.

<h3>ngTable<div class="ng-social-container"><ul class="ng-social" id="ngtable-github"></ul></div></h3>

I decided on <a href="http://bazalt-cms.com/ng-table/" target="_blank">ngTable</a>. This directive has great pagination, customization, and strong filter/sorting capabilities. I've also been able to find a lot of answers and support for questions online. View example [plnkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/ISa4xg?p=preview).

#####ngTable custom filter example

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{% raw %}
getData: function($defer, params) {
  // custom filter applied
  filteredData = _.reduce(_.toArray($scope.filters.filterByFieldType), function(sum, val) {return sum + val}) > 0 ?
          $filter('filterByCheckboxColumn')(filteredData, $scope.filters.filterByFieldType, 'Field') :
          filteredData;
  // order data by selected column
  var orderedData = params.sorting() ?
          $filter('orderBy')(filteredData, params.orderBy()) :
          filteredData;

  // set total for recalc pagination
  params.total(orderedData.length);
  // return data with promise
  $defer.resolve(orderedData.slice((params.page() - 1) * params.count(), params.page() * params.count()));
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Final thoughts
As always I am having a great time with how declarative AngularJS is and the fun that is directives. I highly recommend ngTable for all your data table needs. Let me know if you have any questions or need help with ngTable.
